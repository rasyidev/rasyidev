## 👋 Hi, I'm Habib

**Transforming data into intelligent solutions.**

Results-driven **Software Engineer** with expertise in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs)**. I focus on building **scalable, production-ready AI solutions**, covering the full lifecycle from data processing and model training to cloud deployment and automation.

Experienced in developing end-to-end ML systems, integrating machine learning pipelines, and deploying models on cloud platforms such as **AWS SageMaker** and **Vertex AI**. Skilled in containerizing AI services using **Docker** for scalable, API-based deployments, and in managing experiments and model versioning using **MLflow**. Passionate about bridging AI research with real-world applications through robust infrastructure and data-driven systems.
